# Serial-Morse-Code-Translator-with-LED-Indicator

## Project Overview

The **Serial Morse Code Translator with LED Indicator** is an Arduino-based project that translates user-inputted text into Morse code and displays it using an LED. The system reads input from the Serial Monitor, converts each character to its corresponding Morse code, and blinks the LED to represent the Morse code signals. This project is ideal for learning about **Morse Code**, **Serial Communication**, and **LED control** with **Arduino Uno**.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- LED
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram

A visual circuit diagram of the project is attached. The diagram illustrates the connections between the Arduino and LED. Make sure to refer to this diagram for proper setup:
