# Serial-Morse-Code-Translator-with-LED-Indicator

## Project Overview

The **Serial Morse Code Translator with LED Indicator** is an Arduino-based project that translates user-inputted text into Morse code and displays it using an LED. The system reads input from the Serial Monitor, converts each character to its corresponding Morse code, and blinks the LED to represent the Morse code signals. This project is ideal for learning about **Morse Code**, **Serial Communication**, and **LED control** with **Arduino Uno**.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- LED
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram

A visual circuit diagram of the project is attached. The diagram illustrates the connections between the Arduino and LED. Make sure to refer to this diagram for proper setup:

## Working Video

A video demonstrating the functionality of the project is available. The video shows how the LED blinks according to the Morse code representation of the text inputted via the Serial Monitor:

## Instructions

**Connect the Components:**

1. Connect the LED anode (long leg) to digital pin 3 on the Arduino.
2. Connect the LED cathode (short leg) to the GND pin on the Arduino.

**Upload the Code:**

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Copy and paste the code provided above into a new sketch.
3. Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino.

**Test the Project:**

1. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set the baud rate to 9600).
2. Enter a word or number containing letters (A-Z) and/or digits (0-9).
3. Observe the LED blinking according to the Morse code representation of the entered text.

**Note:**
> Ensure that the Serial Monitor is set to "Newline" for input.
